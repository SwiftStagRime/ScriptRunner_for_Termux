Added ADB control, if your OS flavor supports background execution - you can cold launch scripts correctly.
Command is in the readme - done by separate activity, so should cause no problems.
Note that this will skip runtime args, as it's meant to be ran without touching the phone, thus I can't display UI elements.
Updated all the libs and apg to newer versions. Everything works fine from the looks of things.
Added manual baseline profile for the main workflow, though failed miserably to make StartupBenchmarks work.
